        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
       <p>   Hi! This is Sokna, an 18-year-old boy who comes from Kampong Cham province.  
        I’m a freshman and currently studying at the American University of Phnom Penh.
         I’m majoring in cybersecurity. 
        <br>
         I usually read books in my free time, especially fiction books such as Novel Manga.
         I don’t want to spend my time on social media. I would rather choose to stay at home than go out.
          I don’t like walking so I stay at home and sleep or make something to eat. 
          Others say my life is so boring just come to school and go home. That is because I’m an introverted person.
           I think my life is wonderful, I’m the leader of my life.</p>
